## Academia needs data science

We applaud Stodden *et al.* (1) recent recommendations for improving computational reproducibility in science. We believe there are many unrealized gains in efficiency and impact that can come from embracing statistical and computational ("data science") practices in academia. But some changes are necessary to accelerate this process.

Academic research has proven slow to adapt data science best practices and to retain many brilliant quantitative scientists. This is bad for science, as prevalent data analyses are suboptimal, data-driven discoveries remain underdeveloped, and academia loses highly-skilled people who could use their unique analytic skills to move forward the most pressing scientific questions. 

We propose several reasons why this is happening. First, there is a problem of incentives. Good programming and statistical competence are still not valued enough in most scientific disciplines. In the current 'publish or perish' culture, many scientists are reluctant to invest efforts on learning data science skills that could lead to more powerful, robust and reproducible research. The potential cost on narrow measures of productivity (number of papers) often discourages such investment. To remedy this, we ask our peers to value software and statistical contributions as first class research products during employment, promotion and other reviews.

Second, proper training is hard to come by. Despite the fast increase of online courses and data science programs in some leading universities, most academic centers worldwide do not provide good enough (or even any) training on data science skills, even for quantitative-oriented disciplines. Teaching data science skills should be considered part of the students' core training.

Finally, there is a problem of retention. Many highly-skilled data scientists (mostly postdocs, but also professors) leave academia to work on business or industry where they may get better job stability or working conditions. Academia must find career pathways to support these researchers.

These problems result in a slow uptake of the best data science practice and a 'brain drain' out of academia. Some scientific institutions are already taking measures to ensure this does not slow scientific progress. Others should take note, lest they be left behind.
