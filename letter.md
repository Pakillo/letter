Academia needs data science

We applaud the recent recommendations by Stodden et al. (10.1126/science.aah6168) for improving computational reproducibility in science. Their paper is the latest in a rapidly growing genre calling for researchers to change their behaviors to improve transparency when working with now-ubiquitous complex computational methods. We propose that the set of statistical and computational skills often labeled "data science" can address this call, but that changes are necessary in academia to make the best use of this field.

Academic research has proven slow to adapt best practices in data analysis and to retain many brilliant quantitative scientists. This is bad for science, as prevalent data analyses remain suboptimal, data-driven discoveries remain underdeveloped, and academia loses highly-skilled people who could use their unique analytic skills to move forward the most pressing scientific questions. We believe there are many unrealized gains in efficiency and impact that can come from an embrace of data science practices in academia.

We think there are several reasons why this is happening. First, there is a problem of incentives. Good programming and statistical competence are still not valued enough in most scientific disciplines. In the current 'publish or perish' culture, many scientists are reluctant to invest time and efforts on learning data science skills that could lead to more powerful, robust and reproducible research. The potential cost on narrow measures of productivity (number of papers) often discourages such investment. To remedy this, we ask our peers to value software and statistical contributions and as first class research products during employment, promotion and other reviews.

Second, proper training is hard to come by. Despite the fast increase of online courses and data science programs in some leading universities, most academic centers worldwide do not provide good enough (or even any) training on data science skills, even for quantitative-oriented disciplines. We ask our peers to consider teaching data science skills to undergraduates as part of the students' core training.

Finally, there is a problem of retention. Many highly-skilled data scientists (mostly postdocs, but also professors) leave academia to work on business or industry where they may get better job stability or working conditions. We ask our peers to support career pathways in academia for researchers with data science skills.

In the end, this results in a slow uptake of the best data science skills and a 'brain drain' out of academia. Some scientific institutions worldwide are already taking measures to ensure this does not slow scientific progress. Others should take note, lest they be left behind.
