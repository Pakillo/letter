Academia's problem with data science

In the era of data science and big data, academia keeps failing to foster best practices in data analysis and to retain many brilliant quantitative scientists. This is bad for science, as prevalent data analyses remain suboptimal, data-driven discoveries remain underdeveloped, and academia loses highly-skilled people who could use their unique analytic skills to move forward the most pressing scientific questions. 

We think there are several reasons why this is happening. First, there is a problem of incentives. Good programming and statistical competence are still not valued enough in most scientific disciplines. In the current 'publish or perish' culture, many scientists are reluctant to invest time and efforts on learning data science skills that could lead to more powerful, robust and reproducible research. The potential cost on productivity (number of papers) often discourages such investment.

Second, it is hard to get proper training. Despite the fast increase of online courses and data science programs in some leading universities, most academic centers worldwide do not provide good enough (or even any) training on data science skills, even for quantitative-oriented disciplines.

Finally, there is a problem of retention. Many highly-skilled data scientists (mostly postdocs, but also professors) leave academia to work on business or industry where they may get better job stability or working conditions.

In the end, this results in a slow uptake of the best data science skills and a 'brain drain' out of academia. Scientific institutions worldwide should take measures to ensure this does not slow scientific progress.
